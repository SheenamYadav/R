You are going to create a simple card game of 21. In this game, the single player has to try to come
as close to a score of 21 without going over and beat the computer's score.
1. Set up an array called “PlayingCard” that is having a string representing card’s rank and suit.
For example, the card with rank 1 and suit 'S' is "Ace of Spades".

2. Set up a routine called “DeckOfPlayingCards” which contains the following information:
INSTANCE VARIABLES
 A list of 52 PlayingCard having their rank and suit specified
 Index of the "top" card in the deck
FUNCTIONS
INIT - initializes each PlayingCard tuple to a unique card in a standard deck.
SHUFFLE - randomly permute the order of the cards in the array and sets the top card to the first
card in the array. In order to shuffle the cards, you may use the following algorithm:

for i <-- 0 to 50
pick a random integer j between i and 51
swap card i with card j
end for

DEAL - returns the top card in the deck and sets the top card index to the next card
3. Set up a routine “TwentyOne” which acts a main method that creates the deck of cards and then
allows the user to play the Game of 21.
Rules of the Game
Each card has a point value based on its rank (the suit is ignored in this game). The cards with
ranks 2 through 10 have point values of 2 through 10 respectively. The "face" cards (Jack, Queen,
King) have a point value of 10 each. The Ace is considered as 11 points, unless that puts the player
over a total of 21 points, in which case it reverts to 1 point instead. For example, the following
cards are dealt to the player and the total scores are shown to their right:
CARD CARD SCORE TOTAL SCORE
5 of Diamonds 5 5
Ace of Hearts 11 16
2 of Clubs 2 18
Ace of Spades 1 19
2 of Hearts 4 21

In each game, the deck of cards is shuffled, and the user starts with the first two cards of the deck.
The user may pick the next card of the deck by inputting "HIT" or the user may stop at this point
by inputting "STAY". The user can pick as many cards as he or she wants in order to try to come
up with a score as close to 21 without going over. If the user goes over 21 points, the user
automatically loses and the computer wins. Otherwise, if the user stops with a total score less than
or equal to 21, then the computer plays. The computer starts with the next two cards of the deck.
The computer automatically "HITS" until its score is at least 17. If the computer goes over 21 (but
the user did not), then the user wins automatically. Otherwise, the winner is the player with the
higher score. A tie (same total score) is won by the computer.
Input Processing
Input will come from the keyboard in this game. The user should input "HIT" or "STAY" as the
game proceeds. Any other input should flag an error "Unrecognized input", etc. and you should
ask for the input again. At the end of the game, you should ask the user if he/she wants to play
again. The input here will be "Y" or "N" (lowercase ok). All other input will lead to an error and
you should ask the user to input again. See OUTPUT PROCESSING for an example of correct
input.
